# W.I.P.

## Back to the Common

- This is where "machine wide" includes are.

- This is opposite to the "single header" philosophy.

- This is the "common header" philosopohy

- The common "stuff" is not repeated all arround in all the "single headers"

### Git sub-modules are used because

1. the users/customers clone/pull all the common stuff they need in one go 
   1. from one place on their machines or one server
2. developers have a single place to manage

### The Management

- since here the development also happens there will be a lot of cruft. Potentially.

- thus be carfull not to develop in the master branch
