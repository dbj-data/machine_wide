<h1>Architectural Principles</h1>

## Purpose
Purpose of software architecture is the feasible path to the required software and the feasible path during the maintenance stage in the life of it.

## The programing language and software architect
In IT systems in general, the programming language is not of primary importance. Architecture is.

IT system (not your desktop experiments) is made of components. Each component has a well-defined interface and set of operational requirements. E.g. size, speed, security, and such. If your component does meet operational requirements I really do not care if you have written it in Quick Basic, Julia, Rust, Elm, Awk, Bash Script or C++.

Just after that, it will be rigorously tested for meeting the functional requirements.

## Software and Economy
Do not (ever) forget the economy of IT systems: how much money will it take to develop it and more importantly how much money will it take to maintain what you did, and for the next 10+ years or more.

## The Context
Always start from the run-time environment the required software will be running in. That is the context.

# The Reality and consequences
IT Systems Operational requirements are primarily economy and market driven.
